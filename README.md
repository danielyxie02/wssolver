# WSSolver
Solves Wordscapes levels. That's about it.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
pillow: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/

Android Debugging bridge: https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools

Google Tesseract OCR: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Downloads

pytesseract (python Tesseract binding): https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/

## Limitations
- Only works with black and white letters.
- May be random Tesseract errors
- Doesn't solve puzzles 100% of the time (a few words exist in the WS dictionary but not the actual one...)
